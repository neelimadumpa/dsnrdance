            Dance connects us to society and culture in many universal and personal ways. 
            It deepens our understanding of the world and ourselves. Synthesising persona
            l knowledge and experiences with dance movements reinforces us to perceive the
            feelings and ideas evoked in a dance form. Dance makes us feel happy. When we
            dance, all our worries and stress go away. We get lost in pleasure and joy. 
            Dance is also an exercise that provides numerous benefits to our health, such
            as improving blood circulation, developing muscles, promoting greater flexib
            ility, improving body posture etc. People who dance daily are always fit and
             cheerful. That’s why dancers are very less likely to fall sick.

            Dance has a long history in India. A large amount of material related to dance,
             dating from as early as the 2nd century BCE up to the 21st century CE, is avail
             able. For example, we have a bronze ‘dancing girl’ figurine from Mohenjo-Daro 
             and a broken torso from Harappa in a dance pose. The history of dance can be
             traced back to the classical, middle and modern historical periods.
